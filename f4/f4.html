                Torai9 is a very well-known name through the battles he had with VD, GODZ, DSK in the past. Then, after Torai9 released "Yeah!

Torai9 responded with "Hater Watch". Magazine challenged him to a money battle, and Torai9 won with "Thánh Rap" against Magazine's "Battle", according to the scores from Sol'Bass, Worm JB (G-Fam), Pain (Hazard Clique). Then, Rick jumped in with a series of tracks "Làm King Hay Làm Tình", "Fuck You", "Mày Cay Tao", but Torai9 only responded with "Ân Huệ Của Tao 1" and "Ân Huệ Của Tao 2", then the beef died down.

After that, Hata (G-Fam) released "Đụ Con Mẹ Lũ Bắc Kỳ Ngu". Acy & Black Murder released "Linebacker 2" to close the beef, but the beef did not actually stop, instead, led to the next large battle between the two regions just a few months later.

                This biggest beef started from the conflict a few months before – Northside vs Southside 1. Karik was criticized for losing his color when entering mainstream, leading to him releasing "Ức Chế" (July 2013) in response. This track caused controversy, leading to a series of diss tracks such as "Ức Chế 2 (Điều Tao Suy Nghĩ 3)" – 2See, "Rap Việt 2013" – ppWillyCP, and neutral tracks such as "Có Gì Đâu" – D N, "Im Hết Đi" – Rick. To protect Karik, BigDaddy, Binz, Rhymastic released the track "GATO".

            <hr>
            <p>
                From there, 2See and Rhymastic entered a personal beef with a series of tracks such as "GOTA", "ATOG", "Diss Ngu Si", "Mất Tích", with the victory leaning towards Rhymastic. Acy also joined in with "Da Lowrider", criticizing northside's new school rap and swag, leading to a separate beef with Rhymastic. Rhymastic responded with "Diss Acy", then Acy countered with "Bài Xích". The beef continued with "Diss Acy 2" from Rhymastic, then "Bài Xích 2" from Acy. Rhymastic ended it with "Diss Acy Final", although Acy still released "Kim Chỉ Nam" afterwards. Rhymastic declared the beef to be over, giving Acy the win.

Zephyr (G-Fam, northerner) & Linh Lam (GVR, southerner) released the track "Quan Điểm", protesting against regional discrimination. Linh Lam's verse mentioned Rhymastic, causing the two to argue on the GVR forum. Rhymastic left GVR, joined SpaceSpeakers, and Linh Lam released "Nói Đi".

            <p class="indent">
                Nah released the track "Đấu Với Tao", causing some fans to misunderstand that he was dissing V-O. After discussing, Nah & B Ray decided to stage a drama, in which Nah posted a status attacking B Ray. B Ray responded with the track "The New King", using the beat Daydreamin' by Lupe Fiasco (a rapper that Nah admires). Afterwards, Nah praised B Ray, believing that he would change Vietnamese rap. B Ray continued to release the track "Láo Như Nè". Both later revealed that this was just a "drama" on Clog #3.

            <p class="indent">
                In 2015, Nah was involved in the ĐMCS controversy, in which he was rapping about being against Vietnam’s communism. At the same time, he released the track "Mất Giày" (ft. G.O & Quocboy), satirizing many rappers in Vietnamese rap. Not long after, DSK dissed Nah with "Badabingbing" and "Con Tốt", referring to the ĐMCS controversy. Nah only posted a status expressing his opinion, while B Ray released the track "DS-Cay" to counterattack. DSK did not reply, resulted in the beef to end.

                Skyler (SGM) was criticized for organizing "rap lessons" and selling lyrics to fans, plus the difference in music styles between the two sides, leading to a beef. Skyler opened with "Tập Dắt", dissing Sol'Bass, Young H & B Ray. Young H countered with "Nghèo Mà Đói". After that, Sol'Bass responded with "Lái", but Skyler continued with "Đão", affirming his direction in what he is doing. B Ray joined the battle with "Xử Bắn", causing Skyler to respond with "Dạy Bảo". The beef gradually died down when neither side released any new tracks.
