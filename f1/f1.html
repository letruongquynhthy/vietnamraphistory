                Vietnamese rap had origins from south Vietnamese immigrants in America after the Vietnam War. The Vietnamese community in America around that time was living in neighborhoods with gang violence, and some grew up listening to African American hip-hop. This genre only travelled to Vietnam through the Internet before it started to grow in popularity.

                In Portland, 1997, Khanh Nhỏ and Thai Viet G released the first ever rap song with Vietnamese in it, called "<span><a class="song-links" target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1md35zgEepGNc64fK36SXB?si=49c498715bca4527">Vietnamese Gang</a></span>". The song was about praising Vietnamese people among the diverse communities in America.

                More overseas Viet rappers joined to write Vietnamese rap songs and created a group called “Viet Rapper” (VR). A forum for Viet Rapper was also created online afterwards. Artists in this group included Phong Lê, Xương Khùng, Baby Red, Zolek, Nam Kha, Nhi DJ, and many more. At this point, there were still Viet rappers who use English in their songs and only some in Vietnamese since a lot of them were born in America.

                A lot of these early rap songs were about being against communism in Vietnam, or gang life in America. Some rappers were actually gang members in America, giving rap a bad look for people in Vietnam. Future talented rappers in Vietnam had origins in being in the VR forum. Some known songs from this group are “Đời Anh Thanh Niên – Khanh Nhỏ”, “Vườn Bông Hồng Đỏ – Khanh Nhỏ ft. Phong Lê”.

                Vietnamese rap music was entirely overseas. Then, in 2002, the first person to release a Vietnamese rap song in the actual country is Xlim, a rapper influenced by American rap and used it to write lyrics in Vietnamese.

                In 2002, Xlim also created Da Rap Club, known as RC, based in Hà Nội, the capital of Vietnam. This forum was initially created for people to discuss about rap music overseas. Eventually, RC got to know about Viet Rapper and artists within this forum. Within Da Rap Club, the very first rappers in Vietnam were formed here, particularly those in Viet Spiritz Band, Lil’ Knight (LK) and Fantasy XY (D Cash). The first songs recorded and released by Viet Spiritz Band created a foundation for the future growth of Vietnamese rap.

                Aside from Lil’ Knight and Fantasy XY, other known rappers in RC included Nam CT, One Large, Eddy Việt, Cá Chép (Double C), Young Uno, Lil’ BK, Ken Chou, Chíp Nhỏ, PA (female rapper), Mít Đọt Family (a group). Afterwards, LK, Eddy Việt, Cá Chép, Lil’ BK, and PA created another group under RC, called Viet Dreamerz.

                Most of the conflict between these two groups are about politics. VR was against Vietnam with the communist party while RC viewed VR as traitors of the country. VR’s music are purely follows American rap style while RC only learned from American rap styles but applied materials from Vietnam’s society into their music.

                There was never an end to the conflict, however, it was considered that RC won the war while VR retreated in silence. Moreover, a lot of known artists in VR like Khanh Nhỏ became less active in the rap scene to focus on other things. A few notable diss tracks during this beef from VR are “Hà Nội Sao? – Khanh Nhỏ”, or “Dizz RC – Phong Lê Ft. Xương Khùng”. RC’s side included songs by LK such as “Da Story about HQT”, a few songs featuring with One Large and Young Uno, at the peak of the beef was the track “Quỳ Xuống” by Nam CT Ft. LK & Young Uno.

                By 2004, RC reached more popularity online to the young generations in central and southern Vietnam, even other overseas countries such as Switzerland, Germany, Australia, Canada. More people started to join RC.

            <p>
                The rise of hip-hop in general also had a special milestone in 2004 when RC collaborated with a breakdance club to host a party for folks interested in hip-hop and rap in Hà Nội. Further showing the rise of hip-hop culture in physical action in Vietnam.

                At this point, the Vietnamese rap community still remained underground. All music activities are not publicized often, there was no press, albums, advertising like those in the showbiz. However, within the same year, a mainstream singer Đăng Khôi, reached out to LK to create a song in his album called “Chiếc Lá Tình Yêu Remix”. This event marks the boundary of Viet rap no longer resides underground but also had reached overground as this genre is getting more attention from the public, press, newspaper, and other singers, composers, and especially the young generation of Vietnam.

                Then, the birth of mainstream rappers occurred after this collaboration. Most these rappers were active in Ho Chi Minh City, southern Vietnam. A known mainstream rapper at this time is Đinh Tiến Đạt (Mr. Dee).

                A large difference Vietnamese underground and overground rap is the use of language. With overground music, people are not able to use explicit language or talk about sensitive topics to fit within the Vietnamese societal values. With underground music, rap lyrics are expressed freely without the oversee from the general public.

                In 2005, another forum was created, mainly based in Hồ Chí Minh city, which is Viet Hip Hop (VHH or V2H). Discussions in this forum is not only for people who are interested in rap but also other hip-hop fields like breakdancing, beatboxing, etc. There were hundreds of thousand members in this forum but everyone were mainly focused on mainstream rap and knew little about the underground world. This changed when Viet Hip Hop hosted a competition, “Rapper, Where Are You?” in July 2005. It was a competition for Vietnamese rappers with the winners being LK and Young Uno, and their hit song “Cơn Mưa Qua”. After, a party hosted between Viet Hip Hop and Da Rap Club happened, with the performance of the top 2 rappers at that time, LK and Young Uno. This event has changed the young generation’s view on the Viet rap scene.

                RC and VHH got into a fight since there are different ideas between these two groups. VHH does not have a leader, everyone is as equal as each other, while RC has leading rappers. Rappers in VHH Rap Crew and Dunkare were still new in the rap game so they quickly were defeated by RC’s diss tracks. Afterwards, the VHH forum became more like an archive for posted rap tracks because there was a large number of members in this group, creating a weak link and close relationship between members.
