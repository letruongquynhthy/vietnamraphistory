                After their golden period, from 2009, GVR began to decline significantly. One of the biggest shocks was when Phương CD stopped rapping after releasing the track “The Good Die Young” (collaboration with VD, Andree, DSK). This seriously affected GVR because Phương CD was one of the most important pillars holding up the organization. Next, Lee7 left GVR after the beef with GODZ to focus on his career in Germany, DSK withdrew from rapping for a while, and Andree left, changed his rap name to Andree Right Hand, and pursued his own path. The loss of these big names caused GVR to fall into a state of serious decline.

                Although they tried to maintain the organization with the F2 generation including Rhymastic, Silver C, Ling, etc., this generation of rappers was not strong enough to revive the organization like the previous generation. By the end of 2009, GVR had almost completely disbanded, marking, yet again, the end of a rap empire that once dominated underground Vietnamese rap.

GVR responded weakly with Lil' Dyte's track and "GVR Dun Fuckin' Care 3" (Ling), but was looked down upon by the community. G-Family continued to attack with "Ai Đã Khiến Ling Như Vậy", creating a clearly unequal beef.

When SSR organized the Ready For War tournament, the VUG rappers participating mainly dissed the judges, who were in SSR.

VUG responded with "Southside Flow" (Worm JB), "Long Hổ Tung Hoành 2" and "Lên Ngôi 3M" (Pjpo x VD). The Night (SSR) released the track "Xong Rồi", which was countered by Pjpo with "Phó Tổng Thống Cao Kỳ". The war continued to escalate with many diss tracks from both sides such as "Thằng Ngu", "Thời Cơ 2" (VUG), "Tao Địch Mẹ Mày" (DnH x Crimeezy x TiQ x Pjpo), "Uhm! Thì Là Tướng" (SSR).
