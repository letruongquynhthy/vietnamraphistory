                 At this point, hip-hop and rap are not new terms for young people in Vietnam. Rap becomes a genre with more people listening to. Topics on rap songs become more varied such as love, youth, friendships, student life, etc. Moreover, people are also looking for good rhyme uses in the lyrics aside from use of flow. At the same time, new rappers started to join the rap game with new rap groups formed, creating a great milestone for the Vietnamese rap history. In addition, more artists, producers, and the media are recognizing this genre. This time period is also considered to be a period of a large-scale beef between many new rap groups with high-quality rap skills. The underground scene underwent a few major battles that resulted in real-life confrontations and violence.

                Fan Hip Hop (FHH) was a group founded by VTA (Legend V) and by other northern and southern rappers. Its establishment purpose is to refuse regional separation and distinguishment among the country and also to pursue old-school rap style. To support young rappers, they established the Viet Da Best (VDB) forum, where many talented rappers gather such as VTA, De’Light, Xu Nhim, One Warning Team, Mr. Lonely (Emcee L), Titanz, Lil’ Cool Boy.

                Around the same time, Genius Viet Rap (GVR) was founded by two German-Vietnamese people, First Love (FL) and Phương CD, with the goal to create a rap “playground” for Vietnamese rappers in Germany. GVR quickly attracted many talents such as DSK, Nah, Lil’ Shady, Lee7, Andree, pursuing the modern hustler music lifestyle. Then, they created the group called “Viger”, which stood for Vietnamese-German, with a hit song “Tiểu Thuyết Tình Yêu – Lee7 ft. Andree, It’s Lee”.

                The beef was one of the largest war in the Vietnamese underground rap at that time. It was a matter of time that this conflict would happen as long as FHH and GVR are co-existing in the same rap scene. If FHH pursues old school rap then GVR has a more modern approach to rap music. Tensions broke out since the end of 2006, with personal conflicts such as VTA versus RC Hải Phòng, VTA versus DSK, Viet Luvz versus Lee7, Phương CD, Andree, DSK, and especially the beef between Lil’ Shady and VTA, Xù Nhím, Dunkare.

                In 2007, the quartet, Lee7, DSK, Andree, Phương CD released the track “30 Phút Cho Rap Việt”, translated to “30 Minutes For Rap Viet”, declaring the rap war on FHH and the entire Vietnamese rap community by mentioning other rap groups in their song such as RC, VHH, RapVN, and even VR. Immediately, RC responded with “Dizz GVR – Young Uno ft. Jay Tee & Jan Saker”, while VTA and his teammates released the song “Dizz GVR”. GVR continued the counterattack with “GVR Dun Fuckin’ Care – Nah ft. Andree, Lee7, DSK, & Phương CD”, pushing the conflict to its climax.

                Unfortunately, the conflict did not stop at music but started to affect their real lives such as their webs/forums being hacked, threats and physical violence. On January 10, 2008, representatives of both sides including VTA (FHH), Halen (SSR), Phương CD, DSK, Andree (GVR) agreed for mutual peace through a peace treaty, ending the battle that caused great losses for both sides.

                After the FHH - GVR agreement was signed, VD joined One Warning Team, a team belonging to SSR and released a fairly successful mixtape. However, due to differences in mindset and lifestyle, VD and Halen quickly had conflicts. Moreover, Halen often mentions about the injuries caused in the last beef with GVR while VD dislikes the idea of bringing this back onto the surface. Tensions erupted when a member of GODZ dissed Halen. The situation got worse when, at the same time, VD did not accept the results of the rap competition between the pupils of GODZ, Baby GODZ and, pupils of One Warning Team, Baby One Warning.

                As a result, a series of diss tracks between SSR and GODZ were released. Unfortunately again, history repeats itself, the climax was on April 13, 2008 when VD was heavily slashed on his head, elbow and leg at a club in Hồ Chí Minh City. Afterwards, Halen, Long Le, Sogin and another accomplice were arrested, receiving a total of more than 30 months in prison, while VD returned to Australia for treatment.

                Before 2006, RC (Da Rap Club) was the largest rap organization in Vietnam. However, the rise of FHH and GVR caused RC to gradually lose its position as many rappers left. LK moved to being mainstream, Young Uno and Ken Chou became less active, Viet Dreamerz (Eddy Việt & Cá Chép) started to collaborate with GVR. In 2007, RC organized one of their most significant parties, “Bốn Năm Sau Khi Rồng Thức Giấc”, translated to “Four Years After the Dragon Awakens”, gathering well-known and skillful rappers such as LK, Nam CT, Ken Chou, Young Uno at the same time when Ken Chou is declaring war on GVR and FHH. Despite the response tracks from both sides, this event could not save RC. By 2008, the RC forum was nearly seem as closed, marking its collapse.

                From 2007-2009, Genius Viet Rap (GVR) was one the strongest organizations of underground Viet rap, participating in many major beefs with FHH, SSR, GODZ. A confrontation with SSR happened. It originated from the long-term conflict between One Warning Team (from SSR) and GVR. After the peace treaty with FHH, GVR gave in and created a separate box for One Warning on its forum, but the two sides still dissed each other through tracks like "Gà Và Rác". After another rapper, Subby, took over SSR instead, the relationship between the two organizations become more peaceful.

                GVR also had beefs internally, notably the Nah versus Lil’ Shady battle through the tracks “Low” (Lil’ Shady) and “Thiêu Thân” (Nah), with Nah winning. Another notable beef was between Tony TK and the groups HL Band (Rhymastic, Silver C, NHT, Clown D) and 94 Band (SSR), leading to the diss track “Pháo Dàn Tony TK”.

Rhymastic and Ling then released two tracks “Drop The G Rhymes” and “I Love You Remix”, continuing to contribute to the GVR versus GODZ beef. GODZ responded with "Thích Quá Đi Chứ 2" (VD, Macthediablo, Roanzao, Acy, Datmaniac, Sol’Bass).
