            <p class="list-1">
                The beef began when RichChoi became famous thanks to "Real Rap" and decided to diss B Ray with the track "Babe Get My Gun", both to strengthen his name and reputation and also because B Ray had made a joke about him. Not letting it go, B Ray immediately counterattacked with "Little Homie", officially erupting the beef.

                After "Little Homie", RichChoi continued to release the track "3 Điều Đức Dạy Bảo" in response. B Ray quickly responded with the track "Thất Đức", keeping the fight fair and balanced.

            <p class="list-1">
                However, despite declaring reconciliation, RichChoi continued to diss B Ray in a verse of the track "3 Con Chó Ngọng 2". This made the conflict between the two sides to not fully end.

                Although the beef ended, one of the most memorable parts was the line “Má mày tên là Ngọc, ông già mày tên là Tuấn Anh", translated to "Your mother's name is Ngọc, your father's name is Tuấn Anh" from B Ray's track "Thất Đức" became a trend. The names "Ngọc" and "Tuấn Anh" were constantly teased by the audience and even used as a fact to diss RichChoi in many beefs later.

                Coincidentally, King Of Rap and Rap Việt both aired their first episode on the same day and ended their shows on the same day. These two shows were competing on different TV broadcast channels.

                However, after the first season, King Of Rap received less support from the general public than Rap Việt. Unfortunately, as of 2025, Rap Việt is the only rap show that continued to its forth season while King Of Rap only had one season since 2020.
